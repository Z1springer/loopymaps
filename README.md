## What It Does

- I hope to take a list or text file that contains a list of names, where the key will be the name of a faction and the value will be if that faction is Loyal or Renegade, and loop through it.
- At each list item, the user will be prompted to add the item to one of two maps
- The user will then be able to print out the Maps into the console
